# Application Security & DevSecOps Project

A hands-on application security project focused on building secure software by integrating security practices across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This project demonstrates real-world DevSecOps principles, tools, and methodologies used to protect modern applications against evolving cyber threats.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Secure application development practices  
- Integration of security into the SDLC (DevSecOps)  
- Threat modeling and risk assessment  
- Vulnerability identification, analysis, and remediation  
- Secure CI/CD pipeline implementation  
- Practical use of industry-standard security tools  

---

## Project Objectives

This project is designed to:

- Build a strong foundation in application security  
- Understand and apply defense-in-depth principles  
- Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in development  
- Implement security controls across the CI/CD pipeline  
- Align application security with modern industry frameworks and best practices  

---

## Key Security Concepts Covered

### Core Security Principles

- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)  
- Authentication, Authorization, and Session Management  
- Secure design and defense-in-depth strategies  

---

### Threat Modeling & Risk Management

- Understanding attack surfaces and threat actors  
- Identifying vulnerabilities, exploits, and payloads  
- Performing threat modeling on applications  
- Risk rating using industry frameworks:
  - NIST  
  - FAIR  
  - OWASP  
  - CIS RAM  

---
